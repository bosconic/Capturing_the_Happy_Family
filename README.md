# Capturing_the_Happy_Family

This repository pertains to the Canada GSS Family Cycle 31 Of 2017

We want to point out in order to reporduce the results seen here, please refer to the CHASS database. CHASS (Computing in the Humanities and Social Sciences) Data Centre has partnered with many institutions with the purpose to allow students from many disciplines to have access to data and try to interpret our world through data, some would argue that our "WORLD BECOMES DATA", through whatever the researcher takes interest in. As a Group Elizabeth, Benner and I decided to focus our attention on Canadian Families and see if we can spot any correlation between Families who are beginning to introduce a new being into the world. We would also like to point out that our findings were just one of the many compelling narratives noted from the dataset.

To access the data you have to have access to the CHASS website and follow these folloing steps:
1) Open CHASS website *here you might need to log in with an institution*
2) *click* SDA @ CHASS follow the prompts
3) What you want once you enter the data base is the Canadian (GSS) Surveys
4) Once choosen the proper survey you need to download the CSV, dictionary and label files seperately
5) At this point you should have access to the data, and now you can use the starter code provided in scripts as a guide. 
        **STARTER CODE WAS GRACIOUSLY GIVEN TO US BY ROHAN, WHO HAD CREATED THE CODE WITH HIS COLLEGUE SAM** 
6) At this point you should be elbow deep in code its okay no need to panic just take one step at a time


Best,


Nicholas, Elizabeth and Benner
